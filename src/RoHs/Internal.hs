-- Evidence

-- The evidence for a *ground* constraint
--
--    R '[s0 := t0, ..., sk := tk] ~<~ R '[s'0 := t'0, ..., s'l := t'l]
--
-- is a k-ary tuple of the indices of each `si` in the `s'j`s.

-- Concern: do we need to know the *sizes* of evidence to implement generic
-- operations?  For example, we might want to have a general composition
-- operator `(r0 ~<~ r1) -> (r1 ~<~ r2) -> (r0 ~<~ r2)`... but how can we know
-- how big a record to generate?

-- Eventual concern 2: We'll need to know the *sizes* of row types *in general*
-- to be able to implement `ana` and `syn`.

-- For now, let's assume that evidence is a pair (k, r) where r is the k-tuple
-- as above.  Or, perhaps we want a k+1 tuple (k, i0, .., ik)... would this
-- actually make a difference?

-- Examples

e1 :: (Int, (Int, Int)) -- (R '["y" := Bool, "z" := Int]) ~<~ (R '["x" := Int, "y" := Bool, "z" := Int, "w" := String])
e1 = (2, (1, 2))

compose :: (Int, a) -> (Int, b) -> (Int, c)
-- again, we seem to need to iterate our definition... I'll do only a few cases
-- I am concerned that we're going to stack up `unsafeCoerce`s, and that will
-- lead to underspecified types (and so misbehaving coercions) in the middle...
compose (0, _) _ = (0, unsafeCoerce ())
compose (1, d) (_, e) = (1, unsafeCoerce (MkSolo (unsafeNth i e))) where
  MkSolo i = unsafeCoerce d
compose (2, d) (_, e) = (2, unsafeCoerce (unsafeNth i e, unsafeNth j e))  where
  (i, j) = unsafeCoerce d
compose (3, d) (_, e) = (3, unsafeCoerce (unsafeNth i d, unsafeNth j d, unsafeCoerce k d ))  where

--
-- is supposed to be an invertable function from the si'' to the si + si'.
--
-- My current theory is: we represent that function as a pair (l, r) where r is
-- an l-ary tuple, each entry of which is a pair (0, i) or (1, j).

-- Examples

e3 :: (Int, ((Int, Int), (Int, Int))) -- (R '["y" := Bool]) ~+~ (R '["z" := Int]) ~ (R '["y" := Bool, "z" := Int])
e3 = (2, ((0, 0), (1, 0)))

-- TODO: we are supposed to be able to "invert" evidence of `Plus`: if we know
-- `Plus x y z`, we should also know `x ~<~ z` and `y ~<~ z`.  In `Surface.hs`,
-- I work around this by assuming *both*, but users should not run into this.  A
-- couple of options:
--
-- 1. In the RÏ‰ formal development, I just used a triple of the "real" evidence
--    for Plus and the two containments as the evidence for Plus.
--
-- 2. We could actually have a function to invert evidence.
--
-- For now, I'm not making a choice.....

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Records
--
-- So there are a couple of ways we could do records.  Approach (1) would be to
-- represent an n-ary record as an n-tuple; the 0th element is in position 0,
-- and so forth.  The nice thing about this is that it's simple.  The not-nice
-- thing is that projection becomes a *linear* operation, which has to copy each
-- cell of the input record  Approach (2) would be to store a lookup table in
-- each record; projection would then just be composition of lookup tables.

-- Upon starting to implement approach 1, I discovered another problem---`prj`
-- gets duplicated for each size of record.  I'm bored of that gimmick, so let's
-- just start with approach 2.

-- TODO: what about 0-ary records?  Ignoring for now, I suspect...

prj :: (Int, a) -> ((Int, c), d) -> ((Int, e), d)
prj d (e, r) = (compose d e, r)

field :: Int -> ((Int, c), d) -> e
field n ((_, d), r) = unsafeNth (unsafeNth n d) r

field0 :: ((Int, c), d) -> e    -- essentially unlabel for records...
field0 = field 0

cat :: (Int, a) -> ((Int, c), d) -> ((Int, e), f) -> ((Int, g), h) -- these types are increasingly hilarious
-- 0 and 1 require 0-ary records, ignored per above
cat (2, fs) r p = ((2, unsafeCoerce (0, 1)), unsafeCoerce (get (unsafeNth 0 fs) r p, get (unsafeNth 1 fs) r p)) where
  get (0, n) r _ = field n r
  get (1, n) _ p = field n p
cat (3, fs) r p = ((3, unsafeCoerce (0, 1, 2)), unsafeCoerce (get (unsafeNth 0 fs) r p, get (unsafeNth 1 fs) r p, get (unsafeNth 2 fs) r p)) where
  get (0, n) r _ = field n r
  get (1, n) _ p = field n p
cat (4, fs) r p = ((4, unsafeCoerce (0, 1, 2, 3)), unsafeCoerce (get (unsafeNth 0 fs) r p, get (unsafeNth 1 fs) r p, get (unsafeNth 2 fs) r p, get (unsafeNth 3 fs) r p)) where
  get (0, n) r _ = field n r
  get (1, n) _ p = field n p

-- Umm right, let's see if anything does anything
-- Also maybe we should be flattening the end of this structure...

r1 :: ((Int, (Int, Int, Int, Int)), (Int, Bool, Int, String))    -- R0 (R '["x" := Int, "y" := Bool, "z" := Int, "w" := String])
r1 = ((4, (0, 1, 2, 3)), (1, True, 2, "Foo"))

r2 :: ((Int, (Int, Int)), (Int, Bool))                 -- R0 (R '["y" := Bool, "z" := Int])   c.f. Apoorv, can we just sort field names...
r2 = ((2, (1, 0)), (3, False))

-- Variants
--
-- In some kind of naive world, we might imagine that just as records are
-- implemented as tuples and `unsafeCoerce`, we could implement variants as
-- n-ary `Either`s with `unsafeCoerce`.  However, this seem to make it difficult
-- to implement both branching and coercion, as relabeling constructors would
-- require rebuilding the underlying values.
--
-- Instead, let's implement variants as pairs `(Int, a)`, where the first `Int`
-- identifies the constructor.

-- Ana
--
-- Let's have a little think here.  Ideally, we'd be able to get away with
-- something like:
--
--   ana f (k, x) = f x
--
-- Because `f` is generic over which actual case it applies to.  *However*, we
-- need to pass `f` a couple of pieces of evidence:
--
--   1. Evidence that the case it's seeing is part of the whole (i.e., the `Plus
--      (R '[s := t]) y z` evidence)
--
--   2 & 3. Also, `R '[s := t] ~<~ z` and `y ~<~ z` (although see note above,
--   this should not be necessary)
--
--   4. Evidence of the `All` constraint.
--
-- Oh right, so we should figure out what the `All` constraint looks like.  I
-- think the implementation here will have to approximate to a fair degree---GHC
-- doesn't yet let me actually reify dictionaries or pass them to terms with
-- qualified types, does it?

-- Crucially, however, the `All` constraint will let us sneak in the size of the
